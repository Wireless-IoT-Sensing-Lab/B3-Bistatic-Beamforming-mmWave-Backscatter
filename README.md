#  B3: Bistatic Beamforming for mmWave Backscatter

This repository provides the **implementation**, **hardware design**, and **experimental data** for the **Bistatic Beamforming Backscatter (B3)** system ‚Äî a high-frequency mmWave backscatter tag that enables efficient **beam-steered communication** between transmitters, receivers, and passive backscatter devices.

---

##  Overview

**B3** demonstrates bistatic beamforming techniques that significantly improve **link robustness**, **signal strength**, and **energy efficiency** in mmWave backscatter systems.

This repository includes:
- **Hardware design files** for the custom bistatic backscatter tag and RF front-end ‚Äî allowing researchers to **reproduce or extend** the hardware design for their own projects.  
- **Antenna design documentation** detailing the tag‚Äôs **transmit beamforming** and test configurations.
