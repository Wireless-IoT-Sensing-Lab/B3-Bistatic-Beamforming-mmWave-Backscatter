## Overview

**B3** explores bistatic beamforming techniques to enhance link robustness and energy efficiency in mmWave backscatter systems.

The repository includes:
- Hardware design files for the custom backscatter tag and RF front-end to help any researcher to reproduce this tag for their future projects
- Antenna design description for tag TX beamforming
